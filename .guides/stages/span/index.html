  <p>In the 1830s, Lowell Mason set the nursery rhyme to a melody adding repetition in the verses:</p>
  <p class="verse">
    <strong>Mary</strong> had a little lamb,<br/>
    His fleece was white as snow,<br/>
    And everywhere that Mary went,<br/>
    <span class='last-line'>The lamb</span> was sure to go.
  </p>
    
  <p class="verse">
    <em>He</em> followed her to school one day,<br/>
    Which was against the rule,<br/>
    It made the children laugh and play<br/>
    <span class='last-line'>To see</span> a lamb at school.
  </p>
  
  <p class="verse">
    <b>And</b> so the teacher turned it out,<br/>
    But still it lingered near,<br/>
    And waited patiently about,<br/>
    <span class='last-line'>Till Mary</span> did appear.
  </p>
  
  <p class="verse">
    "<strong>Why</strong> does the lamb love Mary so?"<br/>
    The eager children cry.<br/>
    "Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know."<br/>
    <span class='last-line'>The teacher did</span>  reply. 
  </p>
